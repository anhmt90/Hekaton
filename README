The semantic of the program is described in file 'writeup-dbimp.pdf'.

The branch master contains the program executing the (original) transaction newOrder with single thread.
The other branches are used for correctness and performance testing:
	- Branch 'test-visibility-validation': test for read stability. 
	- Branch 'test-phantom-avoidance': test for phantom detection.
	- Branch 'test-cascaded-aborts: test for cascaded aborts in the context of commit dependencies.
	- Branch 'test-scanning': test scan speed of the program by scanning the OrderLine table multiple times.
	- Branch 'read-only': test performance of read-only transactions.
	- Branch 'update-only': test performance of update-only transactions.
